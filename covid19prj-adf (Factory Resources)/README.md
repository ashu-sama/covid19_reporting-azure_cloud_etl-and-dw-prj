# Azure Data Engineering Project Overview (Covid 19)

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Microsoft Azure, incorporating various Azure services for data ingestion, storage, transformation, and analytics.

## Architecture Overview
The project follows a multi-stage data processing pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Data is ingested from a HTTP Connector and Azure Blob Storage.
   - Ingested data is stored in the Raw Container of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Utilizes Azure Data Factory for orchestrating data workflows.
   - Employs Mapping Data Flow for data transformation.
   - Leverages Databricks for advanced data processing tasks.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - Raw data is stored in the Raw Container of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
   - Processed data is stored in the Processed Container of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

4. **Data Loading:**
   - Processed files are loaded into Azure SQL Database for further analytics.

5. **SQL Analytics:**
   - Various SQL analytics are performed on the Sqlized Data in Azure SQL Database.
     
6. **Security**
   - Credentials stored in Azure Key Vault
   - Access Control using System Assigned Managed Identity.
     
7. **Versioning:**
  - Utilized Git for versioning of data and code artifacts to manage changes effectively.

## Key Components and Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Factory:** Orchestrates and automates data workflows.
- **Mapping Data Flow:** Performs data transformation within Azure Data Factory.
- **Databricks:** Used for advanced data processing and analytics.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2:** Storage for both raw and processed data.
- **Azure SQL Database:** Houses the processed data for SQL analytics.

## Enhancements/Considerations which are not covered in the project but should be incorparated
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for monitoring pipeline health and performance.

- **Data Quality:**
  - Data quality checks at various pipeline stages to ensure data integrity.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Robust error-handling mechanisms to manage failures gracefully.

- **Cost Optimization:**
  - Regularly review and optimize resources for cost efficiency using Azure Cost Management tools.

- **Automated Testing:**
  - Implement automated testing for pipeline components to prevent regressions.

- **Scalability:**
  - Assess and optimize the pipeline for scalability to handle growing data volumes.

- **Long-term Storage and Archiving:**
  - Implement a data retention and archiving strategy for historical data.

## Conclusion
This Azure Data Engineering project demonstrates a robust end-to-end pipeline for efficiently ingesting, processing, and analyzing data. It incorporates best practices for monitoring, security, and scalability, ensuring a reliable and scalable solution.
